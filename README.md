# The-Eight-Puzzle

Many problems can be framed as a search for a series of actions that take you from some initial state to some goal state. Examples include robot navigation, route finding, and map labeling. For such a problem, the state space of the problem is the collection of all states that can be reached by starting in the initial state and applying some number of actions. State-space search is the technical term given to the process of searching through the state space for a path to the goal state, and many different algorithms have been developed for that process.

The project involves applying state-space search to a classic problem known as the Eight Puzzle, which weâ€™ve discussed in lecture. The Eight Puzzle is a 3x3 grid containing 8 numbered tiles and one empty or blank cell. 
Here is one possible configuration of the tiles, with the blank cell shown shaded blue:

Tiles that are adjacent to the blank cell can move into that position in the grid, and solving the puzzle involves moving the tiles until you reach the following goal state:

This project applies state space search to solve any valid initial configuration of the Eight Puzzle.

A puzzle is represented by a string of digits, where the 0 represents the blank space. For example, "142358607" would represent the board:
